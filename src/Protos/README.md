# Protobuf Contracts
This folder contains protocol buffer (Protobuf) source files, which contain messages that are used to define the shape of packets between the client and server akin to a contract. Protobuf is a technology developed by Google for use in their remote procedure call framework, gRPC, but can be used standalone for language-agnostic data serialization.
